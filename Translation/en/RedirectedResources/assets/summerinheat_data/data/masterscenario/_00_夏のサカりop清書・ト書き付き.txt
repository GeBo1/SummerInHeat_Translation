The summer sun poured down on the walls of the
school building, the grounds, my own clothes… It
was so clear that it bounced off all over the place.

Despite how clear it was, the air was humid and
humid, characteristic of midsummer.

Just sitting there doing nothing was enough to make
a stain on her clothes as sweat streamed from her
forehead to her chin and from her neck to her body.


***BGround_BG03_01


I’m a live-in janitor at a school in a rural town
in the mountains. Since I was born and raised
here, this is my alma mater.

Now that the number of students had decreased compared to when I’d
been attending, they’d gathered students with a wide range of ages
to avoid disbanding the school and run it as a single-minded school

When you hear that it’s a rural town in the mountains,
you tend to think summer is easier to pass the time in
comparison to a green, cool, inconvenient, yet lively city

…That’s not true at all. It’s true that there’s a
lot of nature here, but we’re not in a remote area
surrounded by mountains in all directions.

The mountains are only visible in the distance, with flat
land, houses, and fields. It’s a little old, but there’s also
a new residential area. Only the station is a little lively.

There was no Pleasure Quarter, and no matter how
fast we hurried to the urban area, it would take
more than an hour to get there.

In this era, the closed-off nature of the land,
which was born whether you wanted to or not when
you decided on a face to face with, was alive and well.

There’s nothing unusual about it. It must be the
　most common ‘country’ in the country.

Being a janitor in a place like this was simply
too boring.


***BGround_BG00_01

And it’s right in the middle of summer. In other
words, school is on summer break. At the very least,
there aren’t many female students here to comfort her.

I plucked the summer grass and was drenched in sweat,
trying to catch my breath in the shade, but instead of
breathing, all the moisture was draining from my body.

主人公
『At this rate, it’s no wonder that old man’s going
　down.』


***SELoop_FadeOut
***BGround_BG99_01
***SE_footsteps_Asphalt_Trainers_Walk_Slow_x8_loop_mono

My room was far hotter than the outdoors… In other
words, I started walking back to the janitor’s
office for the time being.

Let’s get out of the school building to avoid the
sun as much as possible.


***BGround_BG06_01
***BGM_夏空、静寂、蝉しぐれ
***SELoop_se_COCicadasILS2R_48khz_24bit_購入済み{45}

I walk down the hallway, where there’s almost no
sign of any students even during the day. It’s a
little cooler than outside.

The old man has been a janitor at this school
since I was a student. He must be quite old. He
fell ill around the beginning of summer…

Now that I’ve started recuperating for my return,
I’m temporarily placed in an open post.

I only became a janitor a few days ago, and since
it was a temporary job, I was no different from a
part-timer.

主人公
『This is the easiest thing to do.』

My work doesn’t last long in the first place.

There’s no way I’d quit after arguing with someone,
or get fired because I couldn’t do it at all, but
no matter what I do, I get bored and become bored.

It’s not that I’m tired of being an excellent
person who’s learned how to do it completely.
It’ll just be boring, and I’ll get more and more lazy.

Once you can do it to a certain extent, you’ll
notice all sorts of flaws, like efficiency. But
you don’t have the energy or the ability to fix them.

As a result, I just hate it. I don’t have much
willpower or endurance to begin with.

If that’s the case, it’s like counting down the
seconds until I quit or get backtracked.

主人公
『The club was like that, too…』

***SE_School Playground with Movement_1_re

I turned my eyes in the direction of the club’s
voices outside.

I’m aware that the basics aren’t good either. So,
it’s easy to just move from place to place in a
state where I can eat.

I don’t know what it’s like to be a company animal
when you can’t get much money. I think you’re
doing a good job.

Her parents found her work on their own, and she
was given a little money so that it would flow as
it was

I was chased out of my family’s house to the urban
area to stand on my own, but…

Every job was short-lived, and the gambling and
brothels I went to on my days off or whenever I
had free time ran out of funds for living.

This job was unsatisfying due to its low salary,
but since it was summer vacation, it wasn’t very
busy, so I was grateful to be able to laze around

Thanks to living here, she’s a family member who
says she doesn’t have a regular job at her age… Or
rather…

Most of the time, I’d be able to stay away from
Nee-san’s nagging family.

…Now then, what should I do next after I get back
to my room, take a break, and cool off my sweat…?

？？？(CH01_0000)
『Ah! Hello, Uncle.』


***Flash_In_Black


She turned around, a voice clearly directed at her
echoing behind her.


***ST_オトハ_A1_デフォ(着衣)_目デフォ_口微笑_赤み03_中央


？？？(CH01_0001)
『…Were you busy?』


I’m surprised.

A beautiful, almost transparent girl was standing
there.

It looked fainter than the white floor that
resembled linoleum shining in the sunlight.

To put it simply, it’s neat and tidy. And even
though she’s extremely tidy, she doesn’t give off
a harsh impression at all.

On the other hand, the reason she looks so docile
might be because of the softness of her gaze.

…The atmosphere and voice made me suddenly think.

主人公
『Hey, Otoha-chan… right?』

I couldn’t help but be captivated. I hurriedly
called out to check.

***ST_オトハ_B3_デフォ(着衣)_目悲しい・テレ_口微笑_赤み02_中央


小鳥遊 乙羽(CH01_0002)
『Yeah, it’s Otoha. I guess… I didn’t understand?』


I didn’t think she’d come to school today.

This girl is Takanashi Otoha.

The only reason I knew her name, albeit
uncertainly, was because she was my niece.

主人公
『It’s been quite a while since we actually met, so
　I wasn’t sure. I heard you were back here,
　though.』

***ST_オトハ_B3_デフォ(着衣)_目悲しい・テレ_口微笑_赤み02_中央

小鳥遊 乙羽(CH01_0003)
『The last time we met, I was still small, after
　all.』


主人公
『You’re right. But the resemblance is exactly what
　it looks like.』

***ST_オトハ_A1_デフォ(着衣)_目大笑い_口微笑_赤み03_中央

小鳥遊 乙羽(CH01_0004)
『Hehe. I’m glad you understand that it’s me.』


***ST_オトハ_A1_デフォ(着衣)_目デフォ_口微笑_赤み02_中央

小鳥遊 乙羽(CH01_0005)
『Uncle. So you’re a janitor here, just like I
　heard.』


主人公
『That’s right. Otoha-chan… It looks like a lot’s
　happened. How’ve you been?』

***ST_オトハ_B3_デフォ(着衣)_目デフォ_口微笑_赤み03_中央

小鳥遊 乙羽(CH01_0006)
『Yeah, I’m doing fine somehow. Besides, I didn’t
　think I’d get to see you today, Uncle…』


***ST_オトハ_B3_デフォ(着衣)_目大笑い_口大笑い_赤み03_中央

小鳥遊 乙羽(CH01_0007)
『I’m so happy I cheered up.』


I couldn’t believe that such a brave, honest girl
had been born from that nagging sister of mine.

I’d been her playmate when I was young, so I knew
Otoha-chan well.

主人公
『Now that I’m here, you’ve grown quite a bit.』

***ST_オトハ_B3_デフォ(着衣)_目微笑_口微笑_赤み02_中央

小鳥遊 乙羽(CH01_0008)
『Hehe, we haven’t seen each other in five years.』


Her shy yet proud smile, which was typical of a
growing daughter, was adorable.

***ST_オトハ_C2_デフォ(着衣)_目微笑_口微笑_赤み02_中央

小鳥遊 乙羽(CH01_0009)
『You’ve grown taller, haven’t you?』


I had my eyes on the other parts of her that had
grown. Five years had changed a girl like this…

Her breasts, which had begun to assert themselves
since long ago. The contours of her body, her
skeletal frame, which was gradually starting to curl up.

Her overall plumpness was also somewhat soft,
despite the fact that her innocence hadn’t left
her at all

She’s starting to smell feminine. That vague
feeling is strangely arousing.

***ST_オトハ_C2_デフォ(着衣)_目大笑い_口微笑_赤み02_中央

Since she was so young that she couldn’t play, her
hair was unmatchedly beautiful and glossy, forming
a ring of light.

And her skin is so firm that it feels like it’s
repelling not just beads of sweat, but water as
well. It’s fine-tuned.

It made me want to savor the sensation with my own
hands and pet her all over.

…Or at least, that’s what I was surprised to find
myself lusting after my niece, whom I hadn’t seen
in a while.

She may be my niece, but to be honest, I want to
hold her.

***ST_オトハ_C1_デフォ(着衣)_目驚き_口無表情_赤み02_中央

小鳥遊 乙羽(CH01_0010)
『Uncle…san…?』


Otoha-chan started talking in a troubled tone
because she kept staring at her body.

***ST_オトハ_B3_デフォ(着衣)_目悲しい・テレ_口微笑_赤み03_中央

小鳥遊 乙羽(CH01_0011)
『Does this uniform bother me after all…?』


主人公
『Hm…?』

She seemed to be thinking about something else
entirely.

***ST_オトハ_C3_デフォ(着衣)_目悲しい・テレ_口微笑_赤み03_中央

小鳥遊 乙羽(CH01_0012)
『This uniform is from my previous school. This
　school isn’t a sailor, is it?』


主人公
『Y-Yeah. You’re right. It’s summer right now, so
　there’s a lot of short-sleeved shirts.』

I was a little taken aback by her overly innocent
thoughts, and there was a strange sense of
impatience mixed in with her reply.

Fortunately, she hadn’t been found out that she
was looking at her own niece sexually.

***ST_オトハ_B3_デフォ(着衣)_目デフォ_口微笑_赤み02_中央

小鳥遊 乙羽(CH01_0013)
『Yesterday, when I went to buy the uniforms here,
　they told me you were just out of the right size
　for me.』


***ST_オトハ_B3_デフォ(着衣)_目悲しい・テレ_口無表情_赤み02_中央

小鳥遊 乙羽(CH01_0014)
『Apparently it’ll take a while to get it in…』


小鳥遊 乙羽(CH01_0015)
『So it looks like I’ll be wearing this uniform for
　a while. The school told me that’s fine, so I’m
　fine, but…』


Ignoring Otoha-chan, who was in trouble, I was
excited by the unexpected good fortune of being
able to see a schoolgirl in a sailor uniform for a while.

主人公
『That’s a problem… But I think Otoha-chan would
　look good in either a sailor or the uniform here.』

***ST_オトハ_B3_デフォ(着衣)_目微笑_口微笑_赤み04_中央

小鳥遊 乙羽(CH01_0016)
『Th-Thank you… But even if there aren’t many
　people during summer vacation, I’ll still stand
　out a little.』


The embarrassment on her face makes me want to do
it again.

If I don’t consciously suppress it, I won’t be
able to stop fantasizing about the Otoha-chan in
front of me.

If I let it slip, it’ll be a pain. I have to
change the subject…

主人公
『Oh yeah, Otoha-chan came back to this town
　yesterday, didn’t she? Nee-san came here first.』

***ST_オトハ_B3_デフォ(着衣)_目デフォ_口微笑_赤み04_中央

小鳥遊 乙羽(CH01_0017)
『That’s right. My mom came here first, and she
　seemed to be doing things like moving in and
　taking care of my transfer process.』


Otoha-chan moved to this town.

Not only did she move here, but to be more
precise, she moved elsewhere and came back again.

主人公
『I’m sure you’ll be lonely being separated from a
　friend you made over there. If you’re okay with
　being an uncle, I’ll listen to you.』

I was genuinely worried about my niece… or rather,
I made a proposal from the bottom of my heart.

***ST_オトハ_B3_デフォ(着衣)_目デフォ_口微笑_赤み02_中央

小鳥遊 乙羽(CH01_0018)
『No, I’m fine.』


***ST_オトハ_A1_デフォ(着衣)_目悲しい・テレ_口微笑_赤み02_中央

小鳥遊 乙羽(CH01_0019)
『Everyone over there… was studying for entrance
　exams, so I don’t have that many memories of
　playing around.』


Oblivious to her lustful eyes, Otoha-chan fidgeted
lightly on her legs, perhaps to divert her own
emotions.

The soft-looking fat covering her fawn-like legs
seemed to be inviting me.

主人公
『So that’s how it was.』

I try to keep myself from getting horny, but I
still remember Otoha-chan’s circumstances.

Otoha-chan’s parents―in other words, my older
sister, and her father-in-law’s older brother-
in-law―would both be famous in the neighborhood

She’s an avid educator. Enthusiasm is an obsessive
way of putting it… Honestly, it’s out of the
ordinary.

Otoha-chan had decided to go to a famous school
early on, with her parents overdoing it, and she
moved there for that purpose.

The fact that she had returned meant she had
failed her entrance exams.

That wasn’t the only reason, but Nee-san, with her
pride, wouldn’t tell me the details.

***ST_オトハ_A1_デフォ(着衣)_目悲しい・テレ_口無表情_赤み01_中央

小鳥遊 乙羽(CH01_0020)
『I’m sorry. It’s gotten dark when I’m with you,
　Uncle…』


主人公
『No. I’ve known for a long time that Otoha-chan’s
　having a hard time, and she’s still working hard.
　It’s okay.』

***ST_オトハ_B3_デフォ(着衣)_目微笑_口微笑_赤み03_中央

小鳥遊 乙羽(CH01_0021)
『Thank you, Uncle.』


Seeing her reply so happy from the bottom of her
heart, I can’t help but feel relatively horny.

She’d always had a decent appearance, but to be
honest, I hadn’t expected her to grow up to be
this cute and enchanting.

***ST_オトハ_B3_デフォ(着衣)_目デフォ_口微笑_赤み03_中央

小鳥遊 乙羽(CH01_0022)
『Ah, and then there’s that. Class progress was different between
　my previous school and this one… and it’s been decided that I’ll
　be attending supplementary lessons during summer vacation.』


主人公
『Everyone’s off, but it’s tough.』

***ST_オトハ_B3_デフォ(着衣)_目大笑い_口微笑_赤み03_中央

小鳥遊 乙羽(CH01_0023)
『But studying is important.』


I guess that’s what she really thinks. Speaking of
Otoha-chan, I get the impression that she’s always
studying.

No matter how he spends his time, his body matures
with age. Just thinking that Otoha-chan is
approaching that time of year…

Feeling the characteristic lewdness and
seductiveness of her mature body, I couldn’t look
away again.

主人公
『You’re as serious as ever, Otoha-chan.』

Even though she said that with her mouth, even she
could tell that she was half-empty out of lust.

Even in a brothel, I couldn’t play with such a
young, fresh girl no matter how much I served her.

***ST_オトハ_B3_デフォ(着衣)_目デフォ_口微笑_赤み02_中央

小鳥遊 乙羽(CH01_0024)
『I’m on my way to talk to the teacher about all
　sorts of things, including supplementary lessons.』


***ST_オトハ_B3_デフォ(着衣)_目微笑_口微笑_赤み04_中央

小鳥遊 乙羽(CH01_0025)
『I felt a little helpless because I didn’t know
　anyone, but if you’re at school, Uncle, it’s kind
　of reassuring.』


Five years ago, when we were together, I missed
people’s skin, and sometimes I would pretend to
pet them and touch places that were dangerous…

I had never seen or wanted to touch her this much
as a woman.

If she was going to school during summer vacation…
she might have a chance.

After all, Otoha-chan is attached to me.

***SELoop_FadeOut

？？？(CH03_0000)
『Otoha! So this is where you were?』


***ST_オトハ_B3_デフォ(着衣)_目驚き_口驚き_赤み00_中央


My terrible voice echoes through the hallway, as
if waking up in an instant.

Behind Otoha-chan, a familiar figure stood a short
distance away.


***SE_ヒール足音Footstep_Concrete_HighHeels

It was getting closer and closer with the sound of
footsteps.

This is my sister… Reiko Takanashi.

The silence in the hallway made the high-pressure
voice sound even more irritating.

***ST_レイコ_A1_デフォ(着衣)_目悲しい・テレ_口への字_赤み01_右１

小鳥遊 麗子(CH03_0003)
『That’s what happens. Pre-time behavior is common

　right to come early.』


When I finished speaking to Otoha-chan, who was
completely curled up, she turned to look at me.

***ST_レイコ_A1_デフォ(着衣)_目怒り_口への字_赤み01_右１

小鳥遊 麗子(CH03_0004)
『Hey, dear. Aren’t you at work?』


主人公
『…That’s right.』

I don’t want to talk to her. It’ll definitely be a
pain, or I’ll just make her feel bad.

***ST_レイコ_A1_デフォ(着衣)_目睨み_口への字_赤み01_右１

小鳥遊 麗子(CH03_0005)
『Is it your job to hold Otoha back and talk
　pointlessly?』


主人公
『......』

Why is Reiko-nee-san…? Why can she always spit
sarcasm out of her mouth?

With just a few words, I’m fed up with people to
the core.

***ST_オトハ_A2_デフォ(着衣)_目困り_口困り_赤み02_左１

小鳥遊 乙羽(CH01_0029)
『U-Um, Mom, it’s not that Uncle held me back. I
　found Uncle and talked to him… so.』


小鳥遊 麗子(CH03_0006)
『That doesn’t mean you’re responsible for standing around
　talking and neglecting your job the whole time. It’s the
　responsibility of adults who don’t refuse, you know?』


***ST_オトハ_A2_デフォ(着衣)_目困り_口つぐみ_赤み02_左１

小鳥遊 乙羽
『...』

It’s just that Otoha-chan and Reiko-nee-san didn’t
come back to this town because they failed their
entrance exams.

Even if she doesn’t want to say it, as long as
we’re family, there’s something I can’t hide.

Reiko-nee-san had divorced and come back. That was
the one thing I knew for sure.

I pushed my brother-in-law to take responsibility
for the failure of the entrance exams and started
arguing with him…

In the end, there was no doubt that he had three
and a half lines thrust at him.

If it were me, I wouldn’t want to marry a woman
with a personality like this, no matter how good
she looks.

***ST_レイコ_A3_デフォ(着衣)_目困り_口への字_赤み01_右１

小鳥遊 麗子(CH03_0007)
『Why don’t you stop being quiet and get back to

小鳥遊 麗子(CH03_0008)
『Mother said it was a job even you could do, so
　you managed to find a way to set it up, didn’t
　you?』


…Yeah, my mom did find this job.

It’s true that I was able to get a job through my
connections at my alma mater because I knew what I
wanted to do, and because I was a member of Takanashi.

But it wasn’t like I’d asked her to find a job.

小鳥遊 麗子(CH03_0009)
『At least do your best. Honestly…』


小鳥遊 麗子(CH03_0010)
『You’re old enough to change jobs one after
　another… Don’t you have a sense of responsibility
　or danger?』


Otoha-chan also fell silent, bewildered, partly
because I remained silent.

Reiko-nee-san hadn’t noticed the atmosphere
itself, let alone the feeling of trying to do
something about it.

主人公
『…Shut up.』

***ST_レイコ_B1_デフォ(着衣)_目怒り_口への字_赤み02_右１

小鳥遊 麗子(CH03_0011)

I couldn’t help but slip up. Actually, I was at

小鳥遊 麗子(CH03_0012)

　have something to say, why don’t you say it

Even though she was at her limit, Reiko-nee-san
couldn’t stop easily at this point. …She really
did slip up.

小鳥遊 麗子(CH03_0013)

It’s not embarrassing at all… Does she think that
coming back from a divorce isn’t the shame of her
family?

I start to get irritated again. …That said, when I
see Otoha-chan shrinking back, I shake off my
thoughts.

Let’s get the situation under control somehow.

主人公
『…Anyway, Reiko-nee-san, you’re here for something
　too, aren’t you?』

***ST_レイコ_A1_デフォ(着衣)_目睨み_口への字_赤み01_右１

小鳥遊 麗子(CH03_0014)
『Isn’t it obvious? Once I’m done interviewing my
　homeroom teacher, there’s also the PTA president’s
　job.』


I almost laughed at her insistence that it was a
position I had gained through my own efforts.

…It’s no different from how I got this job through
my connections.

My family, Takanashi’s house, is a prestigious
house in this town. However, it’s only here.

That makes it a little wider. That’s also unique
to the countryside. I’m sick of it.

Even if Reiko-nee-san was an honor student who acknowledged both
herself and others, even if she was an alumna who was proud of
herself, someone who had only just returned for the first time in several years

It wasn’t even time to switch shifts, but I
couldn’t suddenly become PTA president.

It hasn’t changed the fact that I haven’t noticed
that part.

Otoha-chan looks like she’s about to burst into tears,
but her voice gets rougher in the end. Reiko-nee-san’s
attack stops for a moment, apparently taken aback.

Her eyes dart around awkwardly. She looks more or
less like a mother.

小鳥遊 乙羽(CH01_0033)
『Mom, it’s time… I-I’m really going to be late for
　the interview… I’m sure Uncle has work to do,
　too…』


Sensing that Reiko-nee-san’s momentum had weakened
a little, Otoha-chan mustered her voice.

It was like this five years ago, too…

As the daughter of me, the eldest son of
Takanashi, and Reiko-nee-san, the talented woman
I’m proud of.

Otoha-chan would be thoroughly scolded if she
didn’t continue to be an honor student and always
get excellent grades.

While our genders and ages were different, we had
a kind of sense of camaraderie.

This Reiko-nee-san was our common enemy.

…That said, Otoha-chan doesn’t hate Reiko-nee-san.
She’s just bad at it.

After spitting out those parting words, she
quickly started walking away without looking at
me.

***SELoop_se_COCicadasILS2R_48khz_24bit_購入済み{45}

Rather than feeling refreshed after leaving, she’s
feeling really sick. That’s why I hate her…

小鳥遊 乙羽(CH01_0034)
『M-Mister… Um… I’m sorry. My mom said something
　terrible like that…』

『There’s nothing for you to apologize for,

小鳥遊 乙羽(CH01_0036)
『Mom says it really harshly, so I don’t want you
　to get hurt.』


…Otoha-chan was so calm and good-natured that I
wanted to tilt my head to see if she really was
the child Reiko-nee-san gave birth to.

『Hahaha, I’m fine. But thank you.』

She looked back at me a few times as she left.

Seeing Otoha-chan off, who was cute and had a good
personality, had calmed down the feeling of being
so irritated.

That said, whenever Reiko-nee-san’s face crossed
my mind for even a moment, I got really angry
again.

I’m tired from all the work outside. Anyway, let’s
head back to the janitor’s office and take a nap.

And… before that, let’s let out this horny sexual
desire of Otoha-chan’s.

I wake up and wake up. It looks like it’s evening.
Maybe I slept a little too much.

The room that’s hazy smells like sperm. That alone
should have been enough to clear my mind, but now
I’m irritated.

At this hour, she couldn’t even hear the club
anymore. She must have withdrawn.

The lack of people was no different from noon; the

After a short walk, I heard a female student
talking.

There’s… two of them up ahead. They’re walking
towards me…

小鳥遊 乙羽(CH01_0040)
『Ah… Uncle!』


When Otoha-chan noticed me, her face brightened.

Drawn in by her voice, the other figure turns
toward me. Her eyes widen as soon as she sees me.

***ST_リノ_B3_デフォ(着衣)_目驚き_口困り_赤み02_右１

***ST_リノ_C1_デフォ(着衣)_目困り_口無表情_赤み02_右１

In contrast to the bouncing Otoha-chan, the girl
next to her fell silent after noticing me.

***ST_オトハ_A1_デフォ(着衣)_目大笑_口微笑_赤み02_画面外
***ST_リノ_C1_デフォ(着衣)_目困り_口無表情_赤み02_中央

As Otoha-chan introduced her, the girl who fell
silent next to her was her childhood friend,
Akatsuki Rino.

暁 莉乃
『......』

***ST_オトハ_A1_デフォ(着衣)_目大笑_口微笑_赤み02_左１

I was surprised when I met Otoha-chan, too, but
Rino’s eyes widened when she saw me

I was also surprised on the inside that she was
here.

…That said, this school was a one-way school, so
it wouldn’t be surprising if Rino-chan went
straight to college.

***ST_オトハ_A2_デフォ(着衣)_目驚き_口驚き_赤み02_左１

小鳥遊 乙羽(CH01_0044)
『Huh, maybe it’s been a while since Rino-chan last
　saw her uncle, too?』


***ST_オトハ_A2_デフォ(着衣)_目デフォ_口微笑_赤み02_左１

『Ah, ahh, yeah… It’s been a while since I last saw
　you, Uncle. But why are you here…?』


***ST_オトハ_A2_デフォ(着衣)_目大笑い_口微笑_赤み02_左１

小鳥遊 乙羽(CH01_0045)
『Well, Mister, I heard you became a janitor at
　this school. And not long ago.』


***ST_リノ_B3_デフォ(着衣)_目困り_口無表情_赤み02_右１

暁 莉乃(CH02_0002)
『…Huh, I-I see. I didn’t know that.』


The normally docile Otoha-chan beckoned to me with
an unusually lively expression.

It was a stark contrast to how Rino looked.

***ST_オトハ_C1_デフォ(着衣)_目驚き_口無表情_赤み02_左１

小鳥遊 乙羽(CH01_0046)
『Rino-chan, what’s wrong?』


暁 莉乃(CH02_0003)
『No, there’s nothing. I’m still a little
　surprised…』


***ST_オトハ_C1_デフォ(着衣)_目大笑い_口微笑_赤み02_左１

小鳥遊 乙羽(CH01_0047)
『Seriously, it’s kind of surprising. It’s such a
　coincidence! When all three of us are together
　like this, it reminds me of the past.』


***ST_リノ_B3_デフォ(着衣)_目困り_口微笑_赤み02_右１

暁 莉乃(CH02_0004)
『Y-Yeah.』


…I understand why Otoha-chan’s so excited.

***ST_オトハ_C1_デフォ(着衣)_目大笑_口微笑_赤み02_左１

Rino-chan was Otoha-chan’s only friend.

Thanks to Reiko-nee-san putting her studies first,
Otoha-chan had almost no friends, despite being
from her hometown.

Meanwhile, this Rino-chan was the one who had been
patiently inviting her to hang out and watching
her from a young age to get along with her.

***ST_オトハ_B3_デフォ(着衣)_目微笑_口微笑_赤み03_左１

She’s a little older than Otoha-chan in age, but
she’s cheerful and lively like an older sister.
And a caring girl.

Reiko-nee-san, who had been busy with a lot of
things, had taken care of them a lot in the past.

I remember Rino taking Otoha-chan by the hand, who
was easy to get scared of, and jumping into new
games and the playgrounds we found.

Thanks to that, I’ve known Rino for a long time.

主人公
『Rino-chan, it’s been a while.』

***ST_リノ_C1_デフォ(着衣)_目困り_口無表情_赤み02_右１

暁 莉乃(CH02_0005)
『It’s… been a while…』


***ST_オトハ_B3_デフォ(着衣)_目デフォ_口困り_赤み02_左１

小鳥遊 乙羽
『…?』

Otoha-chan looked at Rino-chan curiously.

***ST_リノ_B2_デフォ(着衣)_目悲しい・テレ_口微笑_赤み02_右１

暁 莉乃(CH02_0006)
『It’s been a while, so even I’m nervous.』


***ST_オトハ_B3_デフォ(着衣)_目デフォ_口微笑_赤み02_左１

小鳥遊 乙羽(CH01_0048)
『Hmm… I see. Hmm… You’re right. I got excited.』


***ST_オトハ_B3_デフォ(着衣)_目大笑い_口微笑_赤み02_左１

Otoha-chan continued with a happy, complicated
tone of voice.

***ST_オトハ_B3_デフォ(着衣)_目微笑_口微笑_赤み02_左１

小鳥遊 乙羽(CH01_0049)
『Oh yeah, Uncle, I heard that Rino-chan’s in the
　rhythmic gymnastics club. That’s amazing.』


***ST_リノ_A2_デフォ(着衣)_目悲しい・テレ_口困り_赤み02_右１

暁 莉乃(CH02_0007)
『O-Otoha…』


***ST_リノ_A2_デフォ(着衣)_目悲しい・テレ_口微笑_赤み02_右１

主人公
『Huh. Rino-chan’s doing rhythmic gymnastics, huh?』

暁 莉乃(CH02_0008)
『Y-Yeah…』


As soon as I heard the word rhythmic gymnastics, a
leotard figure came to mind.

The thought of Rino-chan wearing an erotic outfit
that perfectly matched her body line, one that
couldn’t hide her body…

My eyes naturally follow Rino’s body as if
appraising her.

***ST_リノ_C1_デフォ(着衣)_目悲しい・テレ_口微笑_赤み03_右１

Compared to Otoha-chan, her body is more feminine
and round. And it’s taut in moderation.

This girl is pretty nice too. She’s growing up to
be her type.

…If I stare at them too much, I’ll end up
empty-headed. Let’s listen to what they have to
say for now.

***ST_オトハ_A2_デフォ(着衣)_目悲しい・テレ_口微笑_赤み02_左１

小鳥遊 乙羽(CH01_0050)
『I didn’t have any club activities at my previous
　school, so I’m a little jealous.』


***ST_リノ_B1_デフォ(着衣)_目デフォ_口微笑_赤み02_右１

暁 莉乃(CH02_0009)
『Otoha. Why don’t you come check out the club
　sometime?』


***ST_オトハ_A2_デフォ(着衣)_目悲しい・テレ_口微笑_赤み02_左１

小鳥遊 乙羽(CH01_0051)
『Yeah. But I’m not very athletic… and I don’t
　think I’ll be able to do rhythmic gymnastics.』


***ST_リノ_B1_デフォ(着衣)_目大笑い_口微笑_赤み02_右１

暁 莉乃(CH02_0010)
『I couldn’t do anything when I started, either.
　Everyone’s like that at first, so why don’t you
　give it a try?』


***ST_オトハ_B3_デフォ(着衣)_目悲しい・テレ_口微笑_赤み02_左１

小鳥遊 乙羽(CH01_0052)
『Y-Yeah. You’re right. Maybe I’ll think about it
　if Mom forgives me.』


***ST_リノ_B1_デフォ(着衣)_目悲しい・テレ_口デフォ_赤み02_右１

暁 莉乃(CH02_0011)
『Oh, I see. It’s been a while since I’ve
　remembered. Otoha’s mom’s so strict.』


***ST_オトハ_B3_デフォ(着衣)_目悲しい・テレ_口無表情_赤み02_左１

小鳥遊 乙羽(CH01_0053)
『Y-Yeah… I’m sorry I couldn’t give you a clear
　reply after you’ve gone out of your way to invite
　me.』


***ST_リノ_B2_デフォ(着衣)_目微笑_口微笑_赤み02_右１

暁 莉乃(CH02_0012)
『No. There’s no need to apologize. I’ve known
　Otoha for a long time.』


***ST_オトハ_B3_デフォ(着衣)_目大笑い_口微笑_赤み02_左１

小鳥遊 乙羽(CH01_0054)
『…Thank you. You’re so kind, Rino-chan.』


As I listened to their exchange, I remembered how
young they looked, and it seemed that they hadn’t
changed at all since before we were separated.

***ST_オトハ_A1_デフォ(着衣)_目デフォ_口微笑_赤み02_左１

小鳥遊 乙羽(CH01_0055)
『By the way, have you been hanging out with your
　uncle for a while since I moved here?』


***ST_リノ_B2_デフォ(着衣)_目悲しい・テレ_口微笑_赤み02_右１

暁 莉乃(CH02_0013)
『…Hmm, I guess that’s how it felt.』


***ST_オトハ_A1_デフォ(着衣)_目微笑_口微笑_赤み02_左１

小鳥遊 乙羽(CH01_0056)
『So even after I left, you went to the park where
　everyone gathered a lot?』


***ST_リノ_B3_デフォ(着衣)_目デフォ_口無表情_赤み02_右１

暁 莉乃(CH02_0014)
『Yeah, well… But it was five years ago, so I don’t
　remember much anymore.』


***ST_オトハ_A1_デフォ(着衣)_目悲しい・テレ_口微笑_赤み02_左１

小鳥遊 乙羽(CH01_0057)
『Ah… Y-You’re right. …It was a long time ago,
　wasn’t it?』


***ST_リノ_A1_デフォ(着衣)_目悲しい・テレ_口無表情_赤み02_右１

暁 莉乃(CH02_0015)
『Yeah.』


***ST_オトハ_A1_デフォ(着衣)_目悲しい・テレ_口デフォ_赤み02_左１

小鳥遊 乙羽
『...』

暁 莉乃
『......』

There was an atmosphere that was unlike the two of
them, who had been chattering excitedly until just
a moment ago.

Otoha-chan looks back and forth between me and
Rino-chan… but she still doesn’t seem to know what
to say.

***ST_リノ_B2_デフォ(着衣)_目デフォ_口微笑_赤み02_右１

暁 莉乃(CH02_0016)
『……That’s right, Otoha. You said you were curious
　about the pool.』


***ST_オトハ_A3_デフォ(着衣)_目デフォ_口微笑_赤み02_左１

小鳥遊 乙羽(CH01_0058)
『Yeah. My previous school was full of studying, so
　there weren’t any pool classes.』


***ST_リノ_B2_デフォ(着衣)_目微笑_口微笑_赤み02_右１

暁 莉乃(CH02_0017)
『I see. This place is during summer vacation, so
　you’re free to enter unless the swimming club is
　using it…』


When I heard the word pool, I imagined these two
in swimsuits.

I only became a janitor after school started. I’ve
never seen her use the pool in class.

When the swimming club is using it, there’s an advisor. But
if anyone other than the club members can use it freely, I
might be able to see these two in their swimsuits at that time…

I’m looking forward to this.

***ST_リノ_B2_デフォ(着衣)_目睨み_口無表情_赤み02_右１

暁 莉乃
『......』

Rino suddenly looked up at me, as if she could see
through my thoughts.

主人公
『I-I wonder what’s wrong?』

***ST_オトハ_B3_デフォ(着衣)_目驚き_口無表情_赤み02_左１

小鳥遊 乙羽(CH01_0059)
『Rino-chan…?』


暁 莉乃
『......』

***ST_リノ_D1_デフォ(着衣)_目デフォ_口微笑_赤み02_右１

暁 莉乃(CH02_0018)
『Otoha, I’ll teach you how to write the
　application form for using the pool over there.』


小鳥遊 乙羽(CH01_0060)
『Huh…』


Suddenly, Otoha-chan’s arm was taken, and she
started to stagger.

暁 莉乃(CH02_0019)
『Let’s go.』

『O-Oji-san, see you later.』


***ST_オトハ_B3_デフォ(着衣)_目驚き_口焦り_赤み02_画面外


***SE_走り去る足音_concrete normal_running_Mix


Otoha-chan was taken away, still looking like she
couldn’t read the situation.

Before I knew it, the two of them were far away.

…I started walking again.

***SE_footsteps_asphalt_trainers_walk_slow_x8_loop_mono

I’ll be able to see Otoha-chan when she comes to
supplementary lessons.

Reiko-nee-san doesn’t come every day to talk. Even
if I did see her, I’d better avoid her before she
talks to me.

And then there’s Rino. I’m sure I’ll be able to
meet that girl, too. I also know she’s active in
the rhythmic gymnastics club.

There’s a lot to be gained from this unexpected
reunion.

Let’s finish our chores quickly today and think
about where to go, aiming for the place we’ll meet
tomorrow.

I had great expectations for the boring days I had
given up and accepted because I thought it was
summer vacation.

***FadeIn_InSide_Black


It’ll probably be sunny and hot again tomorrow at
this evening. It’s going to be the height of
summer.
