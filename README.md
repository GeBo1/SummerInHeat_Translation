# SummerInHeat_Translation
An unofficial English translation for the game Summer in Heat (夏のサカり) by Miconisomi.

## Installation
0. Install the latest versions of BepInEx x64 v5, BepInEx.ConfigurationManager, [SiH_Tweaks](https://github.com/ManlyMarco/SummerInHeat_Plugins) and XUnity.AutoTranslator.
1. Download the the latest release.
2. If you have any previous translations, consider removing the `BepInEx\Translation` folder.
3. Extract the contents of the zip file into the `GameData` folder of your game. Replace old AutoTranslator config file if asked.

The game should now be fully translated.

If there are any untranslated strings, e.g. because of a game update, you can enable online translations by pressing Alt+0 and selecting a translation endpoint.
